%m is a %a %n.
%m likes to %v.
%i! It's that %m again.
Not even %ns will %v with %m.
%m always wants to %v with a %a %n.
%m and %ns make a good team.
%m and the %n never get along.
%m is always saying, "%i!"
%m is afraid of %a %ns.
%m is more %a that a %a %n!
I even like the %n more than %m.
When the %n is around, %m is a real %n.
