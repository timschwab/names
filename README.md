# names

The classic Schwab program.

### Compilation

Navigate to the root directory of the project and run `make`. This assumes that `make` is installed, so it only works on Linux machines. Otherwise, just run a `gcc` command that includes all the source files, I guess.

### Usage

The executable must be in the same folder as `_settings.ini`. If those two files are in the same folder, run names without any options or arguments.
